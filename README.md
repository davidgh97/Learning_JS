# Learning_JS
Created this repository ( a bit too late tho ) in which I will be recording my path to learning and mastering JavaScript.

I will be adding files with dummy code that I just wanted to test and expriment with.

Sometimes I will be adding files that are mostly comments, but I will be doing that in order to explain in my own words and test my knowledge about certain concepts I have learned about

There will be some file containing problems and excercies - either from courses, problem solving websites, my own ideas, etc.
