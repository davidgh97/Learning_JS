// 6. Object Iteration: Given an object representing a shopping cart with items and their quantities, write a function that calculates the total cost of the items.

/* Smaller STEPS */
// 1) create an object that resembles a shopping cart with item and their quantities
// 2) create a function that accepts as parameters a given object
// 3) iterate through the object
// 4) calculate the total cost of the items in the cart

let shoppin_cart = {
    'cheese': {
        quantity: 4,
        price: '8'
    },
    
    'milk': {
        quantity: 10,
        price: '4'
    }
}

// we are given an object resembling a shopping cart that has other objects inside it 

function totalCost(obj) {
    let object_keys = Object.keys(obj) // Object.keys will create an array including all the keys found inside the object that we pass
    let total = 0 // total will be the product of the QUANTITY and PRICE

    for (let i = 0; i < object_keys.length; i++) { // we are passing through the array generated by Object.keys()
        let key_value = shoppin_cart[object_keys[i]] // here we store inside a variable the KEY: VALUE pairs inside the KEYS we have from the array generated by Object.keys()
        let value_amount = key_value.price * key_value.quantity // bad name for a variable, but here we store the product product of the QUANTITY and PRICE
        total += parseInt(value_amount); // in our case will work without the parseINT method.
    }

    return total;
}

console.log(totalCost(shoppin_cart))
